# Ask

Ask is a web application to help people saving, sharing, and liking their favorite interview questions. The application is currently intended to be used internally at [ThoughtWorksÂ®](http://www.thoughtworks.com), so users are required to authenticate using their Thoughtworks [Okta](https://thoughtworks.okta.com) credentials.

## Stack

Ask is a very minimal [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) application. All depencies specified in the Gemfile). For data storage it uses [PostgreSQL](http://postgresql.org) database in development & production environments and [Sqlite3](http://sqlite.org) in test environment.

There is a [Snap-CI](http://snap-ci.com) which runs the tests and deploys the app to [Heroku](http://heroku.com). Here are the links:

* [Live app](https://askapp.herokuapp.com)

## Building

After cloning the repository, make sure you have the specified Ruby version & Bundler gem installed. Then run

```
$ bundle install
```

If everything goes well, make sure you have a PostgreSQL server running and then setup the database with:

```
$ rake db:create:all
$ rake db:migrate
```

Ensure you have all the tests passing:

```
$ rake
```

And, finally, run the rails server:

```
$ rails s -p 4567
```

Note that you need to specify the port because the server will connect to the [Okta Sample App](https://thoughtworks.oktapreview.com/app/UserHome) to perform authentication for localhost. You'll need an Okta Preview account to successfuly sign-in (a regular Okta account won't work).
